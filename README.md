#Hello World: React and TypeScript

The purpose of this project is to accompany a little guide I'm writing to chronicle my steps to setup a web project with React and TypeScript, [Hello World: React and TypeScript](https://www.gitbook.com/book/charleslbryant/hello-world-react-and-typescript/details). I have ran through many demos, tutorials, and videos on React and TypeScript. Yet, finding up to date info on writing React apps with TypeScript was hard to do at the time I decided to write a guide as I work through the difficulties.

Actually, I started building a demo React and Flux project with TypeScript after watching a Pluralsight video. I was having a hard time converting it to TypeScript, so I decided to start with a simpler application as a way to take baby steps to get more familiar with React with TypeScript. The original repository is here - [https://github.com/charleslbryant/reactfluxts](https://github.com/charleslbryant/reactfluxts).
